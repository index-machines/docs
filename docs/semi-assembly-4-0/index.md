# LumenPnP v4 Assembly

These are assembly instructions for the **v4** LumenPnP.

!!! danger "Check Your Machine's Version Number"
    Make sure your LumenPnP version begins with "v4" before continuing with this section. You can find your machine's version number on the insert included in the box.

## What is the LumenPnP?

The LumenPnP is an open source Pick and Place project led by [Opulo](https://www.opulo.io/). The LumenPnP is designed to be accessible and suited towards [mid-scale manufacturing](http://stephenhawes.com/level-2-manufacturing/) and rapid in-house prototyping.

The LumenPnP can reliably place components as small as 0402, and supports both passive and powered feeders. The LumenPnP is completely open source and has an active community with ongoing mechanical, electrical, and software improvements.

## Before you begin

### Machine Orientation and Terminology

Throughout this guide we'll be referring to different orientations and directions of the machine as "left, right, front, back, up, and down." In general, these words are in reference to the typical view of the machine, facing it directly, as shown below.

We'll also refer to putting the machine "back on its haunches." This refers to a feature of the LumenPnP where it can be lifted up by the front rail and let to rest upright on its back feet. This orientation is tremendously helpful for installing things to the staging plate and plugging things into the motherboard. Whenever putting your machine back, make sure the Y gantry is pushed all the way to the back of the machine to prevent backdriving the Y stepper motor driver.

### Usage

Make sure to keep the LumenPnP in a cool, dry environment. Do NOT expose to warm environments or direct sunlight for prolonged periods of time.  Use on a flat, stable surface.

### Help

### Timing

Expect assembly to take about **50 minutes**.

### You'll Need

* Your packaged Semi-Assembled LumenPnP
* A clear, smooth, flat tabletop for assembly
* A computer
* The ability to plug in three high-bandwidth USB-A ports - Your computer will need to communicate with both the data stream that controls the machine, along with two webcam feeds. It might be possible to handle all of this data through one USB port on your computer with an external USB hub, but you might find you need to plug into a few different ports on your computer, depending on the hardware you have.

## Next steps

Let's dive in! The first step is [unboxing your machine](unboxing/).
