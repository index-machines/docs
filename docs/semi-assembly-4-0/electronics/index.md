    ![alt text](img/IMG_3010.JPG)

1. Get the drag chain assembly from the packaging.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3012.JPG)

1. Remove the rubber band from the end shown below. This side of the chain attaches to the machine's head.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3013.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3014.JPG)

1. Lay the drag chain assembly around the machine as shown. 

    !!! info "Check the polarity"

        Ensure the end with the attached 3D print is on the left side of the machine, and the side with a bundle of cables is laying along the right side.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3015.JPG)

1. Grab the print on the end of the chain on the left side. Find the two cables attached to the back side of the print. These cables will fit into the slot on the back side of the machine's head.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3017.JPG)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_3016.JPG) 

1. While guiding the cables into the channel, rotate the end of the drag chain in place as shown. Make sure it's sitting flush against the back side of the machine's head.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3022.JPG)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_3020.JPG)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_3021.JPG)

1. Bolt the head in place using an M5x16mm socket head bolt. Double check that this print is flush with the back side of the machine's head.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3024.JPG)

1. Plug in the top ring light and top camera using the two cables you just routed through the channel.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3025.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3026.JPG)

1. Find the Z motor and Z limit cables on the head, and tuck them into the slot as shown.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3027.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3028.JPG)

1. Plug the Z limit cable into the connector on the back side of the circuit board mounted to the front of the head. Plug the Z motor cable into the Z motor.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3029.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3030.JPG)

1. Check that your machine looks like the image below.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3032.JPG)

1. Pick up the X drag chain and hang it over the back leg as shown below.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3033.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3034.JPG)

2. Get the X gantry drag chain support panel and orient it as shown below, with the text on the right and facing upwards.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3035.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3036.JPG)

3. Lift the drag chain, slide the support panel underneath it, and rest the drag chain on top.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3039.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3040.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3042.JPG)

4. On the left side, align the holes in the support panel with the holes in the Y gantry. The X drag chain should be centered on the support panel.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3043.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3044.JPG)

5. Bolt the left side of the support panel into the Y gantry using `2x` M5x10mm socket head bolts.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3047.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3048.JPG)

6. On the right side, align the holes in the drag chain with the holes in the support panel, and with the holes in the other Y gantry.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3046.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3050.JPG)

7. Bolt the three together using `2x` M5x16mm flat head bolts.

    !!! warning "A Bit of Resistance"
        You should expect to feel some resistance when bolting these three together. The slot in the cable chain is slightly undersized for the bolt, so don't worry if you need to use a little bit of extra force to thread these bolts through.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3051.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3052.JPG)

8. Thread `2x` more M5x16mm flat head bolts through the holes in the Y drag chain by the X motor as shown.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3053.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3054.JPG)

9.  Align these bolts with the holes in the drag chain support by the text "Y Drag Chain Mounts Here" and drop it into place. Loosely thread `2x` M5 nuts onto the bolts.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3055.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3056.JPG)

10. Use the cutout in the squaring bracket to hold the nuts in place while you tighten the bolts using an allen key.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3058.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3059.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3061.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3062.JPG)

11. Plug the X motor cable into the X motor, and plug the XY limit cable into the XY limit switch PCB as shown. Use a zip tie to secure the XY limit cable in place as shown, and snip off the excess using the snips in your tool kit.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3067.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3068.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3069.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3070.JPG)

12. Lay the Y drag chain on top of the control box as shown, align it with the holes in the box, and secure in place with `2x` M5x16mm flat head bolts.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3063.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3064.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3065.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3066.JPG)

13. Rotate the machine so the control box is facing you. Remove the rubber band holding the cable bundle together.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3072.JPG)

14. Separate the USB cable from the bundle and route the rest of the cables into the control box as shown.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3073.JPG)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_3074.JPG)

15. Plug the cables you just routed into their respective ports. Match the labels on the cables with the labels on the control board. Use the images below for reference.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_3075.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3076.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3077.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3078.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3079.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3080.JPG) ![alt text](img/IMG_3081.JPG)
