# Overview

This is the Opulo Feeder:

![hero image of feeder8](img/8mm-v110-no-arm-no-glow.png)

The LumenPnP Feeder is an open source SMT component tape feeder that can reliably feed components as small as 0402. It is designed to work with a LumenPnP Pick and Place Machine, but can mount onto any 20mm X 20mm v-slot extrusion. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/opulo-inc/feeder).

The feeder uses the open source [Photon feeder controller firmware](https://github.com/photonfirmware/photon), and talks the Photon protocol over RS-485 to any Marlin host with RS-485 support.

You can fit up to 50x 8mm or 12mm Feeders on the front and back rail of your LumenPnP when using two staging plates.

If you'd like to add a third staging plate, you can fit 25x 8mm or 12mm Feeders on the front rail of your LumenPnP.

=== "Changing Drive Mode"
    Pressing and holding both buttons at the same time will make the light flash blue. This toggles the feeder from driving tape with long presses, to peeling film with long presses. Press and hold both buttons again to switch back.
