# Wiring

In this step, you will mount and connect all the wiring and pneumatic tubing.

1. Find the `front-drag-chain-mount` print in the first tray, and grab a M5x25mm socket head screw from the hardware bag.

  ![](images/chain-mount-3.JPG)

4. Grab the cable harness from the first tray. One side of the cable chain will have shorter wires, and the other will have longer wires with a print zip tied to it. Place your harness as shown in the image below.
  ![](images/cable-harness.JPG)

5. Check the clip holding the cable that exits the cable chain part way through. If it has popped out during shipping, press it back into place.

13. On the front side of the X gantry, take the connector with four holes but only three wires and plug it into the limit switch PCB.
    ![](images/plug-z-limit.JPG)

14. Take the **unlabeled** connector with six holes and four wires and plug it into the Z motor.
    ![](images/plug-z-motor.JPG)

15. Grab two zip ties from the bag in your tool kit and fit them through the channels in the top side of the X gantry.
    ![](images/zip-tie-1.JPG)
    ![](images/zip-tie-2.JPG)

16. Find the cable labeled `LM`, route it over the top of the Z motor, and secure it in place with the zip tie on the left side of the X gantry.
    ![](images/zip-lh-1.JPG)
    ![](images/zip-lh-2.JPG)

17. Fit a zip tie through the outer slot on the left Z gantry.
  ![](images/zip-lh-3.JPG)

18. Plug the cable labeled `LM` into the left motor on the X gantry. This cable is inserted from the bottom.

    ![](images/head-trim.JPG)

25. Find the two pieces of tubing labeled `LH` and `RH`, and insert `LH` into the left motor, and `RH` into the right motor. Make sure that the tubing is in between the `LH` and `RH` cable harness going to the motors as shown in the image below.
    ![](images/tubing.JPG)
    ![](images/tubing-inserted.JPG)
  
    !!! Note
          If you ever need to remove the tubing, press down on the blue plastic circle while pulling upward on the tubing.

26. Your X gantry should look like the image below.
  ![](images/finished-head.JPG)

27. Take the print attached to the wire exiting from the middle of the cable chain, and align it with the back of the X motor as shown in the image below.
  ![](images/x-umbilical.JPG)

28. Using two M5x16mm socket head screws, mount the X cable guide to the Y gantry. Then plug the cable into the X motor.

36. Remove the plastic wrapping from motherboard-side of the cable chain.
  ![](images/unbag-wires3.JPG)
  ![](images/unbag-wires4.JPG)
  
37. Take a look at the bundle of cables coming from the cable chain. One cable with a USB connector will not be zip tied into the print. Move this cable out of the way for now, as we won't be routing it with the rest of the cables.
  ![](images/isolate-top-cam.JPG)

38. Isolate the following items from the bundle, and guide them under the motherboard from the left side, and out through the top as shown below.
    - `RH` tubing
    - `LH` tubing
    - `XM` cable harness
    - `ZM` cable harness
    - `LM` cable harness
  ![](images/isolate-half-1.JPG)

39. Use two M5x10mm screws and two T-slot nuts to attach the strain relief print into the bottom of the bottom rail in the left leg assembly.
    ![](images/mount-strain.JPG)

40. Plug the `XM` cable harness into the first port from the left (labeled "X"), plug the `ZM` cable harness into the fourth port from the left (labeled "Z"), and plug the `LM` cable harness into the port on the far left (labeled "L").
  ![](images/plug-xm.JPG)

41. Take the two tubes left and stick them back under the motherboard, out the right side, and plug them into the pneumatic fitting that matches the label on the tubing.
  ![](images/guide-tubing-1.JPG)
  ![](images/guide-tubing-2.JPG)
  ![](images/plug-tubing.JPG)

42. Route the remaining three cable harness from the bundle underneath the red and blue vacuum sensor tubing.
  ![](images/route-zl-dl-rm.JPG)

43. Plug the harness labeled `RM` into the first port in the second row (labeled "R").
  ![](images/plug-rm.JPG)

44. Plug the harness labeled `ZL` into the Z Limit Switch port.
  ![](images/plug-zl.JPG)
  
45. Plug the harness labeled `DL` into the Top Light port.
  ![](images/plug-dl.JPG)

46. Tuck any excess cabling underneath the motherboard. Your machine should look like the image below.
  ![](images/wired-overview.JPG)

47. Follow the steps for [installing the Slot Harness](https://docs.opulo.io/feeders/2-install-harness/installing-the-slot-harness/#install-the-harness) here, and then come back to this page for guidance on plugging in the last few wires in the section below.

48. Fit the cover back onto the motherboard by rotating it underneath the pneumatic tubing, and pressing down around the stepper driver pins and heatsinks. Remount using the original two M3x30mm screws.
  ![](images/mount-cover-1.JPG)
  ![](images/mount-cover-2.JPG)

49. Grab the USB <-> 4 pin connector cable from your tool bag, and plug the 4 pin connector into the back of the bottom camera. Attach the cable to the bottom camera mount using a zip tie and snip off the excess.
  ![](images/plug-bottom-cam.JPG)
  ![](images/zip-bottom-cam.JPG)

50. Find the staging plate foot from the second tray, and press fit it onto the bottom camera mount, taking care to align the cutout with the bottom camera cable.
  ![](images/mount-foot-1.JPG)
  ![](images/mount-foot-2.JPG)

51. Route the USB cable underneath the motherboard.
  ![](images/usb-under-mobo.JPG)
  ![](images/final-wiring.JPG)

52. Plug the power supply into a wall outlet, and plug the barrel jack into the port in the upper-right corner of the motherboard. You should see a light come on underneath the cover.
53. Plug the USB-B cable located in your tool bag into the USB port on the bottom-left corner of the motherboard.
54. Lower your machine down onto all four legs.
55. Plug the three USB cables coming from your machine into your computer. Depending on your computer's hardware, you might need to plug these all into separate USB ports on your computer and not use an external hub. We'll cover more about this later during calibration.

You're done with your build! Time to head over to the OpenPnP section of the docs for calibration and running your first job:
