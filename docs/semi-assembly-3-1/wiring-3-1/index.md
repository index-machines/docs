# Wiring

In this step, you will mount and connect all the wiring and pneumatic tubing.

## Installing Front Drag Chain Mount

1. Find the `front-drag-chain-mount` print in the first tray, and grab a M5x25mm socket head screw from the hardware bag.
  ![Drag Train Mount print with screw](images/front-leg-cable-chain-mount.JPG)

2. Place the `front-drag-chain-mount` on top of the front left leg as shown.
  ![Positioning the drag train mount](images/front-cable-chain-mount-placement.JPG)

3. Insert the M5x25mm socket head screw through the print into the front left leg before tightening it down with an allen wrench.

## Installing Drag Chain Assembly

4. Grab the cable harness from the first tray. One side of the cable chain will have shorter wires, and the other will have longer wires with a print zip tied to it. Place your harness as shown in the image below.
  ![Cable harness](images/cable-harness.JPG)

5. Check the clip holding the cable that exits the cable chain part way through. If it has popped out during shipping, press it back into place.
  ![Check cable harness clip](images/x-motor-cable-pop.JPG)
  ![Reattach cable harness clip](images/x-motor-cable-set.JPG)

6. Lift up the harness and place it onto your machine as shown below. Place the side of the cable chain with the longer wires on the ledge in the `front-drag-chain-mount`. It can help to pull your Y gantries forward to give the right side of the harness a place to rest for the next few steps.

## Installing Feeder Slots

The next step is installing the Feeder Slot Cable Harness. Select the appropriate installation instructions linked below based off your machine version.

  * If your machine is a `v3.1`, [install the harness for Individual Feeder Slots](../../feeders/2-install-harness/feeder-slot/index.md#install-the-harness).
  * If your machine is a `v3.2` or greater, [install the harness for Feeder Slot Blades](../../feeders/2-install-harness/feeder-blade/index.md#install-the-harness).

After you complete this step return to this page for guidance on plugging in the last few wires in the next section.

## Finalize Wiring

48. Grab the USB <-> 4 pin connector cable from your tool bag, and plug the 4 pin connector into the back of the bottom camera. Attach the cable to the bottom camera mount using a zip tie and snip off the excess.

  ![Final wiring of motherboard](images/final-wiring.JPG)

51. Plug the power supply into a wall outlet, and plug the barrel jack into the port in the upper-right corner of the motherboard. You should see a light come on underneath the cover.
52. Plug the USB-B cable located in your tool bag into the USB port on the bottom-left corner of the motherboard.
53. Lower your machine down onto all four legs.
54. Plug the three USB cables coming from your machine into your computer. Depending on your computer's hardware, you might need to plug these all into separate USB ports on your computer and not use an external hub. We'll cover more about this later during calibration.

You're done with your build! Time to head over to the OpenPnP section of the docs for calibration and running your first job:
