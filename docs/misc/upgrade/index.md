# Upgrade to v4

v4 has enough changes from the previous release that it's most effective to fully disassemble your current LumenPnP. There are effectively no subassemblies that have not be updated in some way, so a full rebuild is the fastest way to get your machine upgraded.

We highly recommend **picking a version**. Select a [release](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp/releases) starting with `v4` from the LumenPnP Github page and stick to it!

All upgrade parts available on the [Opulo Web Store](https://www.opulo.io/collections/parts) are suited to upgrading to v4.

## Parts

When determining if you have the right parts, always reference the BOM. This is attached to each release. Download the zip file, unzip it, and open the HTML page with your browser. Make sure you have purchased all the parts needed, or already have them from disassembling your old build.

You'll have to print parts as well. There are printing instructions in the BOM file.

If you have questions, please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://www.opulo.io/pages/contact-support).

## Build

With your parts and tools collected, dive into building! We *highly* recommend opening the [FreeCAD model of the LumenPnP](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp/blob/main/pnp/cad/assembly.FCStd) for reference as you build.

The best place to start from is [this OHAI page](https://ohai.opulo.io/lumen/x-gantry/). Note that OHAI is written as internal assembly instructions for Opulo employees. It will reference jigs, tools, and other specifics that you might not have. This is the currently most accurate guide for upgrading your machine until dedicated build instructions are written.
