  Assembling the belt tensioners used throughout the machine
---

Alright, time to get into the build! First, we're going to build the belt tensioners that are used for the X and Y axes. You need to build **three** of these.

| Qty              | Part                          |
|-----------------:|-------------------------------|
| 1 each, 3 total  | M3 Hex Nut                    |
| 1 each, 3 total  | M3x16 machine screw           |
| 1 each, 3 total  | M3 Cap Nut                    |
| 1 each, 3 total  | M5x25 machine screw           |
| 1 each, 3 total  | M5 Nyloc Hex Nut              |
| 1 each, 3 total  | M5x40 machine screw           |
| 1 each, 3 total  | M5 Hex Nut                    |
| 1 each, 3 total  | GT2 Pulley Idler              |
| 1 each, 3 total  | FDM-0037 (Belt Tension Arm)   |
| 1                | FDM-0001 (Front Left Leg)     |
| 1                | FDM-0002 (Front Right Leg)    |
| 1                | FDM-0013 (X Idler Mount)      |

## Assembling the Belt Tensioner Arms

{{< container-image path="images/1-belt-tension-arm-parts.jpg" alt="Belt Tension Arm Parts" >}}

1. Insert an M3 Hex Nut into its slot on the back of a {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/2-m3-nut-inserted.jpg" alt="Inserted M3 Hex Nut" >}}

2. Insert an M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} and then tighten.

3. Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm Machine Screw.
  {{< container-image path="images/4-m3-cap-nut.jpg" alt="M3 Screw, M3 Nut, and M3 Cap Nut installed" >}}

4. Insert an M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler.
  {{< container-image path="images/5-pulley.png" alt="M5 screw and GT2 Pulley Idler positioned" >}}

5. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.

6. Repeat this two more times so that you have a total of **three** arms.

## Attaching a tensioner to the left side

Now you'll attach the first tensioner to the {{< tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001" >}}:

7. Insert an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the {{< tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/7-left-side-nut.png" alt="M5 Nyloc Hed Nut positioned in Front Left Leg" >}}

8. Insert a completed {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm "FDM-0037 >}} assembly between the arms on the {{< tooltip "Front Left Leg" "FDM-0001" >}}, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.
  {{< container-image path="images/8-left-side-arm.png" alt="Belt Tensioner Arm" >}}

9. Insert an M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} and tightens into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.

  {{< container-image path="images/10-left-side-complete.jpg" alt="Idler and Belt Tension Arm installed on Leg" >}}

## Attaching a tensioner to the right side

Next, attach the second tensioner the the {{< tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002" >}}. This is nearly identical to the first one:

10. Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the {{< tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002" >}}.
    {{< container-image path="images/11-right-side-nut.png" alt="M5 Nyloc Hed Nut positioned in Front Left Leg" >}}

11. Insert a completed {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} assembly between the arms on the {{< tooltip "Front Right Leg" "FDM-0002" >}}, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.
  {{< container-image path="images/12-right-side-arm.png" alt="Belt Tensioner Arm" >}}

12. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.
  {{< container-image path="images/13-right-side-bolt.png" alt="M5x40mm screw inserted into Idler and Belt Tensioner Arm" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/14-right-side-complete.jpg" alt="Idler and Belt Tension Arm installed on Leg" >}}

## Attaching a tensioner to the X idler mount

The third and final tensioner is attached to the {{< tooltip "X Idler Mount" "FDM-0013" >}}. This is only slightly different from the previous two:

13. Insert the M5 Nyloc hex nut into the recess on the bottom of the {{< tooltip "X Idler Mount" "FDM-0013" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/15-x-nut.png" alt="Nyloc hex nut installed on the X Idler Mount" >}}

14. Insert the completed {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} into its slot in the {{< tooltip "X Idler Mount" "FDM-0013" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/16-x-arm.jpg" alt="Belt Tension Arm inserted into Idler Mount" >}}

15. Insert the M5x40mm machine screw through the hole in the top of the {{< tooltip "X Idler Mount" "FDM-0013" >}} so that it passes through the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}} and tightens into the Nyloc Hex Nut.  Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the {{< tooltip "Belt Tension Arm" "FDM-0037" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/17-x-complete.jpg" alt="Completed Belt Tension Arm installed in Idler Mount" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/18-x-complete-alt.jpg" alt="Completed Belt Tension Arm installed in Idler Mount" >}}

## Next steps

Now that all the tensioners are in the right place, continue with [assembling the left side]({{< relref "left-side" >}}).
